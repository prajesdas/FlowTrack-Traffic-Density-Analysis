# FlowTrack-Traffic-Density-Analysis
ðŸš¦ TrafficVision: AI-Powered Traffic Density Detection TrafficVision is an AI-based traffic monitoring system that uses OpenCV and Deep Learning to analyze video footage and detect vehicles in real time. This project leverages a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model to count vehicles and estimate traffic density.
